# Analysis of Variants



## What's the point?

In [the previous portion](https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2/tree/master/genomics/4-Variation) of this study we found polymorphisms within SARS-Cov-2 proteins. In this section we are comparing these variants with what we know from related species in the litterature.

## Outline

We performed alignments of each protein to other coronaviruses, and compared the variants in SARS-Cov-2 with what we know of equivalent residues in other species.

## Input

A table of variants generated from a [a previous section](https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2/tree/master/genomics/4-Variation), and alignments generated for each protein similarly to the analysis presented in the
[S-protein Analysis section](https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2/tree/master/genomics/5-S-analysis).
## Output

For each protein, we generated a table of variants with annotations, and more detailled analyses for a few interesting ones. The list of analysis variants will increase with time.
